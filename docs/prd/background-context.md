# Background Context

Vestiaire addresses two critical problems in modern fashion consumption: decision fatigue and wardrobe underutilization. Research shows only 20-30% of owned clothing is regularly worn, while unused items rarely reach the resale market. Users frequently feel they have "nothing to wear" despite full closets.

This mobile-first application targets environmentally conscious Gen Z and Millennials (18-35) who are time-poor but style-aware. By combining AI outfit suggestions with resale integration and gamification, Vestiaire creates a sustainable fashion ecosystem that maximizes existing wardrobe value while reducing impulse purchases.
