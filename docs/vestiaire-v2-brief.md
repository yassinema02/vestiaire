# Project Brief: Vestiaire V2

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Vestiaire V2 transforms the existing personal wardrobe management app into a **social-first, AI-powered fashion platform** that combines daily outfit sharing, AR try-on technology, and intelligent shopping assistance. Building on V1's foundation of wardrobe digitization, analytics, and resale features, V2 introduces five major capability areas: BeReal-style daily outfit sharing with friends, AR virtual try-on using body scans, outfit planning calendar, professional styling services, and a smart shopping assistant that helps users make informed purchase decisions based on their existing wardrobe.

**Target Market:** Fashion-conscious millennials and Gen Z users (18-35) who want to maximize their wardrobe value, share style inspiration with friends, and make smarter shopping decisions.

**Key Value Proposition:** The only fashion app that combines personal wardrobe management, social sharing, AR try-on, and AI-powered shopping guidance in one seamless experience.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

While V1 successfully addresses wardrobe organization and analytics, users face new challenges:

1. **Social Isolation of Fashion Choices** - Users have no way to share their daily outfits or get inspiration from friends' styling. Instagram and Pinterest are too public and curated; users want intimate, daily sharing like BeReal but for fashion.

2. **Uncertainty in Shopping Decisions** - When shopping (in-store or online), users don't know if a new item will actually work with their existing wardrobe. This leads to:
   - Impulse purchases that never get worn
   - Buyer's remorse
   - Wardrobe clutter
   - Wasted money

3. **Limited Visualization of Outfit Possibilities** - Users can't easily visualize how items will look together or on their body before getting dressed or making purchases.

4. **Lack of Professional Guidance** - Most users want styling advice but can't afford personal stylists, leading to style stagnation and lack of confidence.

5. **Reactive vs. Proactive Outfit Planning** - Users scramble each morning to decide what to wear instead of planning outfits in advance for events, trips, or the week ahead.

### Impact (Quantified)

- **Average consumer** buys 60% more clothing than 15 years ago but keeps items **half as long** (McKinsey, 2023)
- **$200-400 wasted annually** per person on clothes that are rarely worn (ThredUp, 2024)
- **87% of Gen Z users** want AR try-on features before purchasing online (Snapchat Study, 2024)
- **Fashion posts** are the #3 most shared content type on social media, but users want more private sharing options (Meta Research, 2025)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Social fashion apps** (e.g., 21 Buttons, Depop) focus on influencers or resale, not daily personal sharing
- **AR try-on apps** (e.g., Zara AR, ASOS Virtual Catwalk) only work with **their own products**, not your existing wardrobe
- **Styling services** (e.g., Stitch Fix, Trunk Club) are expensive ($100-300/session) and require shipping
- **Shopping apps** (e.g., Pinterest Lens, Google Lens) show products but don't integrate with **your specific wardrobe**

### Urgency

- AR try-on is becoming **table stakes** in fashion retail (Zara, H&M, Nike all launched AR features in 2024-2025)
- Social commerce is exploding ($1.2T market by 2025)
- First-mover advantage in **personal wardrobe-integrated AR** before big retailers dominate

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

Vestiaire V2 creates a **social wardrobe ecosystem** where users can:
1. Share daily outfits in a BeReal-style private feed
2. Virtually try on their clothes using AR body scanning
3. Plan outfits in advance with a calendar view
4. Get professional styling advice on-demand
5. Make smart shopping decisions with AI-powered wardrobe compatibility analysis

### Key Differentiators

1. **Personal Wardrobe Integration** - Unlike retail AR apps, Vestiaire's AR works with items users **already own**
2. **Social+Private** - BeReal-style intimacy (not Instagram performance) for outfit sharing
3. **Pre-Purchase AI Assistance** - "Will this work with my wardrobe?" answered **before** buying
4. **Unified Platform** - One app for wardrobe management, social sharing, AR try-on, planning, and shopping

### Why This Will Succeed

- **V1 foundation** - Proven wardrobe digitization, AI categorization, and user engagement
- **Network effects** - Social features create viral loops (invite friends to see your OOTD)
- **Revenue diversification** - Affiliate commissions on shopping, premium styling services, AR subscriptions
- **User lock-in** - More features = higher switching costs

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** V2 development budget: $50K (includes AR tech, third-party APIs, freelance AR developer)
- **Timeline:** 
  - MVP target: 6 months (August 2026 launch)
  - Phase 2: Additional 3-6 months
- **Resources:**
  - 1 full-time developer (yourself)
  - 1 contract AR specialist (3 months)
  - Part-time designer (UI/UX for social features)
- **Technical:**
  - AR limited to iOS initially (LiDAR requirement)
  - Gemini API rate limits (may need quota increase)
  - Real-time social feed performance (Supabase concurrent connections)

### Key Assumptions

- V1 users will adopt V2 features (at least 30% adoption)
- Friends-only social model will drive invites (viral coefficient ≥1.2)
- AR tech is mature enough for production (iPhone 12+ LiDAR proven)
- Users will grant camera/photo permissions for AR and OOTD
- Shopping affiliate programs will approve Vestiaire (typical approval rate 80%)
- Professional stylists will join marketplace (critical mass: 50 stylists)
- Users are comfortable sharing body scans (anonymized, encrypted)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **AR Technical Complexity:** AR body fitting is highly complex. Poor accuracy could damage brand reputation. **Mitigation:** Start with simple overlay AR (less realistic but simpler), iterate to full 3D fitting.
  
- **Social Feature Adoption:** Users may not invite friends (cold start problem). **Mitigation:** Incentivize invites (unlock features after 3 friends), showcase value immediately.
  
- **Privacy Concerns:** Body scans may feel invasive to some users. **Mitigation:** Transparent privacy policy, local-first processing where possible, easy deletion.
  
- **Monetization Friction:** Affiliate commissions require users to click through our app. **Mitigation:** Make value prop clear ("we earn a small commission, no extra cost to you").
  
- **Stylist Quality Control:** Bad stylist experiences could hurt platform. **Mitigation:** Ratings/reviews, curated onboarding, satisfaction guarantee.

### Open Questions

- What's the optimal OOTD posting time/notification strategy? (BeReal uses random times - do we copy?)
- Should AR try-on be a premium feature or free for all?
- How do we handle body image sensitivity in AR marketing?
- What's the right commission split for stylists? (70/30, 80/20?)
- Should we allow users to follow non-friends (public mode) later?
- How do we verify stylist credentials (certifications, portfolios)?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **AR Technology Evaluation:** Test ARKit capabilities, compare with alternatives (Banuba, DeepAR)
- **Competitive AR Analysis:** Deep dive into Zara AR, ASOS Virtual Catwalk implementations
- **Affiliate Network Research:** Which networks have best fashion brand coverage, terms?
- **User Privacy Research:** Survey V1 users on AR body scan comfort levels
- **Stylist Market Research:** Interview 10-15 professional stylists to validate marketplace concept
- **Social Feature Benchmarking:** Analyze BeReal engagement metrics, retention curves
